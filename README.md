# WordNet
A Java implementation of [WordNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordNet).

### Introduction
A WordNet is tree-like organization of the semantic relationship of words in the English language.

This project implements classes for constructing and performing queries on a WordNet, including finding the distance between words and finding their closest common ancestor.

### More Information
An excellent discussion of the WordNet data structure can be found at Princeton's [Algorithms and Data Structures, Part II](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/wordnet.html) website.

### Motivation
This project was completed for [Algorithms, Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2).

If you're in that course or related course right now, obey all honor code requirements before viewing this code.  
I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
